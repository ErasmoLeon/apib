API Bench

This is a tool that makes it easy to test API servers. It is intended
to have many of the features of Apache Bench (ab), but is intended as
a more modern replacement. In particular, it will support:

* Proper HTTP 1.1 support including keep-alives 
* Ability to spawn multiple I/O threads to take advantage of multiple
  CPU cores
* Support for POST and PUT of large objects
* Support for templates so that requests may vary
* Support for OAuth 1.0 and 2.0 signatures
* Ability to output results to a file so they may be automated
* Possibily a "graphical mode" using curses so it's sexy

However, like "ab," it will also support:

* A very simple command-line interface
* Very few dependencies, so it may be easily built and deployed
* Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency

** Dependencies:

* apr -- makes it more portable to Linux, Solaris, Macintosh I think
* openssl -- because we need SSL

Any reasonable platform will have both of these.

** Implementation:

1) Spawn one I/O thread per CPU (configured by user)
2) Allocate a subset of connections to each, and in each:
3) Start event loop
4) If total number of connections < C, spawn a connection
5) Execute HTTP state machine -- connecting, sending, receiving, sending
6) When connections close, replace them to maintain C connections open
7) Record results in a shared area
8) Back in main thread, report on shared results periodically
9) Time in main thread and signal workers to stop eventually
10) Report to screen and to file
